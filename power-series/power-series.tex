\maketitle

We have already dug deep into questions of convergence for series in
general; now, we focus attention on \textbf{power series.}  After
this, we'll consider Taylor series.  So if you fall in love with power
series, there is more to come.  And if you don't like power series,
well, there isn't much left!  Either way, hang in there.

In terms of skills with power series, I am hoping that you'll have the ability to
\begin{itemize}
\item identify a power series,
\item find the interval of convergence of a power series,
\item find the radius of convergence of a power series,
\item differentiate and integrate a power series term-by-term,
\item transform a geometric series to find a power series representation, and
\item build a new power series by multiplying two power series.
\end{itemize}
